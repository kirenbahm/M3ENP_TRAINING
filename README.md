# M3ENP_TRAINING

IMPORTANT:

At ENP, your pull request may not work due to a SSL Certificate error. To remedy this, enter the following command in the Bash shell:

 export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1

After entering that command you should be able to successfully clone the repo to your local working directory with the command:

 git clone https://github.com/kirenbahm/M3ENP_TRAINING.git

You can add the 'export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1' command to .bash_profile in your Git home directory to avoid having to repeat this step each time you log onto Bash.
